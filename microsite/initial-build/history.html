                        <p>[1977] Jöbsis reported that brain tissue transparency to NIR light allowed a non-invasive and
                            continuous method of tissue oxygen saturation using transillumination. Transillumination
                            (forward-scattering) was of limited utility in adults because of light attenuation and was
                            quickly replaced by reflectance-mode based techniques - resulting in development of NIRS
                            systems

                        <p>[2001] In fact, the term “Optical Topography” derives from the concept of using light on

                            been successfully implemented in launching their first fNIRS (or Optical Topography, as they
