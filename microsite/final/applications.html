                                <p>fNIRS electrode locations can be defined using a variety of layouts, including names
                                    and locations that are specified by the International 10–20 system as well as other
                                    layouts that are specifically optimized to maintain a consistent 30mm distance
                                    between each location. In addition to the standard positions of electrodes, short
                                    separation channels can be added. Short separation channels allow the measurement of
                                    scalp signals. Since the short separation channels measure the signal coming from
                                    the scalp, they allow the removal of the signal of superficial layers. This leaves
                                    behind the actual brain response. Short separation channel detectors are usually
                                    placed 8mm away from a source. They do not need to be in a specific direction or in
                                    the same direction as a detector.

                                <p>fNIRS measurements can be used to calculate functional connectivity. Multi-channel
                                    fNIRS measurements create a topographical map of neural activation, whereby temporal
                                    correlation between spatially separated events can be analyzed. Functional
                                    connectivity is typically assessed in terms correlations between the hemodynamic
                                    responses of spatially distinct regions of interest (ROIs). In brain studies,
                                    functional connectivity measurements are commonly taken for resting state patient
                                    data, as well as data recorded over stimulus paradigms. The low cost, portability
                                    and high temporal resolution of fNIRS, with respect to fMRI, have proven to be
                                    highly advantageous in studies of this nature.</p><br>

                                <p>The use of fNIRS as a functional neuroimaging method relies on the principle of
                                    neuro-vascular coupling also known as the haemodynamic response or
                                    blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response. This principle also forms the core of
                                    fMRI techniques. Through neuro-vascular coupling, neuronal activity is linked to
                                    related changes in localized cerebral blood flow. fNIRS and fMRI are sensitive to
                                    similar physiologic changes and are often comparative methods. Studies relating fMRI
                                    and fNIRS show highly correlated results in cognitive tasks. fNIRS has several
                                    advantages in cost and portability over fMRI, but cannot be used to measure cortical
                                    activity more than 4 cm deep due to limitations in light emitter power and has more
                                    limited spatial resolution. fNIRS includes the use of diffuse optical tomography
                                    (DOT/NIRDOT) for functional purposes. Multiplexing fNIRS channels can allow 2D
                                    topographic functional maps of brain activity (e.g. with Hitachi ETG-4000, Artinis
                                    Oxymon, NIRx NIRScout, etc.) while using multiple emitter spacings may be used to
                                    build 3D tomographic maps.</p><br>
