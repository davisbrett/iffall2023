                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical brain monitoring technique which uses
                        near-infrared spectroscopy for the purpose of functional neuroimaging. Using fNIRS, brain
                        activity is measured by using near-infrared light to estimate cortical hemodynamic activity
                        which occur in response to neural activity. Alongside EEG, fNIRS is one of the most common
                        non-invasive neuroimaging techniques which can be used in portable contexts. The signal is often
                        compared with the BOLD signal measured by fMRI and is capable of measuring changes both in oxy-
                        and deoxyhemoglobin concentration, but can only measure from regions near the cortical surface.
                        fNIRS may also be referred to as Optical Topography (OT) and is sometimes referred to simply as
                        NIRS.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> fNIRS estimates the concentration of hemoglobin from changes in absorption of near infrared
                        light. As light moves or propagates through the head, it is alternately scattered or absorbed by
                        the tissue through which it travels. Because hemoglobin is a significant absorber of
                        near-infrared light, changes in absorbed light can be used to reliably measure changes in
                        hemoglobin concentration. Different fNIRS techniques can also use the way in which light
                        propagates to estimate blood volume and oxygenation. The technique is safe, non-invasive, and
                        can be used with other imaging modalities.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> NIRS is a non-invasive imaging method involving the quantification of chromophore concentration
                        resolved from the measurement of near infrared (NIR) light attenuation or temporal or phasic
                        changes. The technique takes advantage of the optical window in which (a) skin, tissue, and bone
                        are mostly transparent to NIR light (700–900 nm spectral interval) and (b) hemoglobin (Hb) and
                        deoxygenated-hemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) are strong absorbers of light.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> There are six different ways for infrared light to interact with the brain tissue: direct
                        transmission, diffuse transmission, specular reflection, diffuse reflection, scattering, and
                        absorption. fNIRS focuses primarily on absorption: differences in the absorption spectra of
                        deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb allow the measurement of relative changes in hemoglobin concentration
                        through the use of light attenuation at multiple wavelengths. Two or more wavelengths are
                        selected, with one wavelength above and one below the isosbestic point of 810 nm—at which
                        deoxy-Hb and oxy-Hb have identical absorption coefficients. Using the modified Beer-Lambert law
                        (mBLL), relative changes in concentration can be calculated as a function of total photon path
                        length.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Typically, the light emitter and detector are placed ipsilaterally (each emitter/detector pair
                        on the same side) on the subject’s skull so recorded measurements are due to back-scattered
                        (reflected) light following elliptical pathways. fNIRS is most sensitive to hemodynamic changes
                        which occur nearest to the scalp and these superficial artifacts are often addressed using
                        additional light detectors located closer to the light source (short-separation detectors).</p>
