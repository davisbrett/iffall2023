        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>My name is Brett Davis. I have majors in Finance and Economics & Strategy and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction. I am currently a senior.</li>
            <li>Though I don't have much coding background, it is something I am interested in. This class looked interesting and fulfills a requirement for my minor, so I decided to take it.</li>
            <li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn how to create interesting looking websites in this class.</li>
            <li>I expect it to be a slower, more thought out, methodical process to design for the screen than for paper.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.aquiline.com/">Aquiline</a>: This is the website of a private equity firm the firm I interned at had worked with. I think the website has a lot of interesting details, such as the dynamic location at the bottom, that shows attention to detail was present when creating it.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.rcarecords.com/">RCA Records</a>: This is a website of a record company, and I think it effectively communicates by putting the artists and their works front and center throughout.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>: The Apple website works well. It is simple to navigate, has a clean design, and a user can very easily and quickly find what he or she is looking for.</li>
