            <em>[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]</em><br>
            Now, here you go again<br>
            You say you want your freedom<br>
            Well, who am I to keep you down?<br>
            It's only right that you should<br>
            Play the way you feel it<br>
            But listen carefully to the sound<br>
            Of your loneliness<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]</em><br>
            Like a heartbeat drives you mad (Heartbeat)<br>
            In the stillness of rememberin' (Stillness)<br>
            What you had and what you lost (Lonely, ooh)<br>
            And what you had and what you lost (Ooh, ooh)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie]</em><br>
            Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'<br>
            Players only love you when they're playing<br>
            Say, "Women, they will come and they will go"<br>
            When the rain washes you clean, you'll know<br>
            You'll know
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Instrumental Break]</em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]</em><br>
            Now, here I go again<br>
            I see the crystal visions<br>
            I keep my visions to myself<br>
            It's only me who wants to<br>
            Wrap around your dreams<br>
            And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?<br>
            Dreams of loneliness<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Nicks]</em><br>
            Like a heartbeat drives you mad (Heartbeat)<br>
            In the stillness of rememberin' (Stillness)<br>
            What you had and what you lost (Lonely, ooh)<br>
            Oh, what you had, oh, what you lost (Ooh, ah)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie]</em><br>
            Thunder only happens when it's rainin'<br>
            Players only love you when they're playing<br>
            Women, they will come and they will go<br>

            <em>[Outro: Stevie Nicks & Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie]</em><br>
            You'll know<br>
            You will know<br>
            Oh, you'll know<br>
