    <p>Total time: 1hr 15mins<br>Bake time: 40-48mins</p>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8x8 Baking Dish</li>
        <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        <li>Parchment Paper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment
            paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake
            for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (Note: it's better to
            pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool before slicing. Store in an
            airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you'd like to reduce the sugar, I've had success with 1 cup granulated sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups.</li>
        <li>I like to use olive oil because it's what I keep on hand and I enjoy the pairing of olive oil with
            chocolate. Keep in mind that you will taste it here. For a more neutral flavor, use canola oil.</li>
        <li>When these brownies come out of the oven, they'll be super gooey in the middle. Allow them to cool
            completely, about 2 hours, before you slice into them to give them a chance to set up. They'll continue to
            firm up the longer they're out of the oven. If you still prefer a firmer brownie, store them in the fridge.
        </li>

    <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://ladyandpups.com/">Lady and Pups</a> - The design of this website is a little different than
            most recipe websites. However, the photos on the website are very detailed, showing textures up close and
            giving a better idea of how a dish should turn out. Additionally, the commentary can at times be humourous.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/">King Arthur Baking Company</a> - This website is very colorful
            and offers many recipes that tend to focus on baking but sometimes venture into food. A helpful section is
            the All Recipe Categories section that lets a user easily navigate to what he or she is looking for.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/">Taste of Home</a> - This website is good for when you're unsure what
            to make. There are many articles listed that follow the likes of "[Large number] of Recipes for [Specific
            Occasion], such as <em>75 Cheap Dinner Ideas for Weeknight Meals</em> and <em>65 Tailgate Recipes to Wash
                Down with a Beer</em>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a> - This website implements text identity very well.
            This font is easily recognizable as associated with The New Yorker. Additionally, I think using different
            sized boxed areas to present different articles could translate to a recipe website.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a> - This website stays simple while
            de-emphasizing text. Photos take prominence, rightfully conveying what the organization's focus is.</li>
        <li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> - This website is designed well and has a structure like a lot of
            other tech companies. Gradients and graphics that change when scrolling are present throughout, along with
            the use of symbols.</li>
    </ul>
